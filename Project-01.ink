Your eyes flutter open, a bright white blinding light hangs above you in empty room with nothing but a small mattress on the floor and giant mirror on the wall that gives an uneasy feeling. You canâ€™t remember who or what you are.  Do you even remember how to speak?

*[Crawl onto the mattress]->mattress

*[Try to speak]->speaking

=== speaking ===

You open your mouth yet only weird nosies come out. what are you even trying to say. You scream out trying to form a sentence, what are you even saying. Help? My is? or Where am i? You stop trying after a while. 

Just then you hear the sound a door open and the sound of something slinding in, then the sound of the door closing.

~ Knife = Knife + 1

You crawl towards the mattress. It smells familiar, and has unknown markings on it but you can't help but feel safe here. Its not comfortable at all, you can't help but feel as if something sharp is in the mattress. What an odd feeling.
